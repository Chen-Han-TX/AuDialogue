### Description:

AuDialogue is a revolutionary app designed to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf and Hearing communities.
Our goal is to enable fluid, effortless communication without the need for an intermediary or a separate communication app.

With Audialogue, both parties can converse using a single mobile device, each holding an opposite edge of the phone. 
This unique design eliminates language barriers and encourages swift, real-time communication.

We believe that every conversation matters, and we're committed to making these conversations more accessible for everyone. 
With AuDialogue, we're transforming the communication landscape - one interaction at a time.
